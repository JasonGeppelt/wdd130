        <p>This is the first time classes have been interesting to me. I started school back in 2020 and oh my gosh it was not for me. I struggled every flipping day to complete the work I was given. At the time I was a bussiness major (because why not). Soon after, the idea of Public Relations sounded appealing so I switched over to communicaitons. Blehh. So now im trying out IT and so far its been really interesting. I hope all goes well.</p>
        <p>I work down at the Best Buy in IF. Its like working at a toy store, I swear all my money I earn just goes right back to them. I've always been interested in computers and tech in general. Recently I finished building another computer. I don't reccommend it, it's a stupid expensive hobby.</p>
        <p>Anyway, thats me! I hail from College Station, TX. If anyone knows where that is, hit me up! Stoked to learn with y'all.</p>
