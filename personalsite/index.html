                <p class="home-p1">Some say the hot dog eating contest originated in Coney Island on Independence Day, 1916 when a small group of four immigrants gathered around the now infamous original Nathan's Famous hot dog stand. The goal was to see which of them was the most patriotic. How to measure one's patriotism? The answer is obvious. A hot dog eating contest.</p>
                <p class="home-p2">Since then, brave men and women have pitted their stomachs against each other to determine the victor. In preparation of these events, many participants prepare by stretching out their stomachs by consuming a large quantity of fiber rich foods such as watermelon and oat meal. Others use a form of ancient form of throat yoga originating in the Mongolian mountains. Tribes of Mongols would show their strengths by sword swallowing. The same methods they used to prepare their throats for that grueling contest are used today. A string is attached to a small rodent or rodent-like creature and is bribed down the esophagus by a previously consumed sausage or spiced piece of meat. The rodent, sensing a meal, clambers down the throat of the trainee. After this, the rat is pulled out and a slightly larger rat is used the same way. As the rats grow larger and larger, the throat is naturally widened.</p>

                <p class="home-p3">Approximately 700 Idahoans attended last year's annual Dog-Eat-Dog hotdog eating contest at the State Fair. Thousands more watched the ESPN telecast of the contest. We would like to publicly apologize for those who stood in what is now considered “The Splash Zone”. Our runner up that year, Chandler Hendrickson reportedly had a sizeable tapeworm intentionally ingested to help with the contest. That plan unfortunately backfired as the worm apparently wasn't a fan of hot dogs. This resulted in one of the farthest reaching projectile vomits ever to be recorded on live television.</p>
                <p class="home-p4">Our state champion Joseph Pinenut currently holds the title of hot dog-eating state champion after setting a new state record of 53 hot dogs and buns in 2021. Last year's female champion, Melany Tesco managed to devour an incredible 32.5 hotdogs in the 10 minute time period.</p>
